# Predicting Bike Rentals
Many U.S. cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities that collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

Each row in the data we'll be using represents the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. You can download the data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

In this project, we'll predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. To accomplish this, we'll create a few different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

### Summary of Results
Our Random Forest model was the best model we created with an R2 score of 0.942.
